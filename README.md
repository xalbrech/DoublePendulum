# DoublePendulum
Simple demonstration of a trajectory of double pendulum. The program plots a trace of the tip (2nd bob) of a double pendulum. 

The program was done as an excercise. The algorithm used is a Java reimplementation of the Python code from https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/

Parameters of the pendulum: rod lengths 1m, bob masses 1kg.

Build with maven (`mvn install`), run with `java -jar target/double_pendulum-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
